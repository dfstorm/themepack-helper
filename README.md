## Fork of fravaccaro themepack-helper

Changed to Inkscape from ImageMagick for a better picture quality.


## What you need

1. Icons in svg.
2. A GNU/Linux distro.
3. **Inkscape** (install it via your package manager).

## Usage
1. Place your icons in `jolla/scalable/icons` if they are Jolla stock icons, `native/scalable/apps` if they are native apps icons and `apk/scalable` if they are Android icons.
2. Rename your icons accordingly with the [wiki](https://github.com/fravaccaro/themepacksupport-sailfishos/wiki/Icons).
3. Launch the script.
4. Go on [packaging your theme](https://github.com/fravaccaro/themepacksupport-sailfishos/wiki).

### Pro tip

Remember to delete `.gitignore` files before compiling.
